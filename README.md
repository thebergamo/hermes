# hermes

Serverless Notification Management System

## Structure

This project follows the [Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) or at least tries to.

You will find the Lambda handlers that are generated by each endpoint inside the `/cmd` folder.

Inside the `/pkg` folder we've all common usage packages + models.

## Getting Started

In order to get started with this project you must have [AWS SAM]() to be able to run the [AWS Lambda]() environment locally. (Pre-req deps of AWS SAM are also required e.g.: Docker)

[Docker compose]() will help you also to run AWS dependencies locally. If you prefer to not have Docker Compose, you can also use [LocalStack]() directly.

After having the depencies resolved you need to run the following commands to start this project for development.

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d # Starts LocalStack in the background
$ make create-tables # all dynamodb tables would be created locally

$ make build && make start-api # this will build your lambdas and start aws sam.
```

> We've also available an [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) collection that you can import. Check out in `/docs` folder.

## Deployment
